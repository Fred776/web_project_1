# *web_project_1: My first Project with TripleTen*
This project consists of a static website built using HTML5 and CSS3. It is aimed at providing information about various learning techniques and links to many interesting learning resources such as Coursera and Ted talks.

## *Features*
I developed some basic skills in HTML and CSS while building this project.    
I notably got acquainted with:
- Unordered lists
- The flex layout model
- Simple CSS animations and transformations such as rotations and translations
- Using the BEM methodology to organize CSS blocks.

## *Contributions*
This project can be used as a template for beginners looking to improve their skills in HTML and CSS. It can be cloned on a local machine for studying and/or editing, and relevant pull requests will be accepted! Required work on the project currently include updating links and logos on the header and footer sections as they relate to TripleTen's former company name (Practicum).

**I would like to thank TripleTen for providing me with the materials and instructions to build this project!**
