# web_project_1
## My first project in the Practicum program.

This project helped me develop some basic skills in HTML and CSS. It consists of a static website informing the visitor about techniques for learning.

Some notable CSS technologies it acquainted me with include the flexbox layout model, transitions and simple animations.
