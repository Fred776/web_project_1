# web_project_1: My first project with TripleTen

This project consists of a static website built using HTML5 and CSS3, and is aimed at providing information about various learning techniques. It links to many interesting learning resources such as Coursera and Ted talks.

The project helped me develop some basic skills in HTML and CSS. It acquainted me with unordered lists, the flex layout model, and simple CSS animations and transformations such as rotations and translations. The BEM methodology was used to organize CSS blocks.

I would like to thank TripleTen to provide me with the material and instruction to build this project!

Some future work on this project could include work on the header and footer sections to update links and logos relating to TripleTen's former company name.
